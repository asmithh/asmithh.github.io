About me 
=====
I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in [Network Science](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at Northeastern University. I am currently supported by an NSF GRFP Fellowship (Grant No. 1938052) in Social Sciences - Computationally Intensive Research, and my advisors are [David Lazer](https://www.lazerlab.net/people/david-lazer) and [Brooke Foucault Welles](https://brooke-welles.squarespace.com/). 

My current work focuses on the human impacts of (and the ways humans can impact) sociotechnical systems. I look at three networked phenomena in my research -- civic discourses, attention dynamics, and information spread -- and analyze how they influence power in networked sociotechnical systems. While my research is primarily grounded in computational social science methods, I also make use of qualitative methods like semi-structured interviews (plus constructivist grounded theory approaches) and autoethnography to better understand the nuances and deeper contexts of the phenomena I observe. 

**I am seeking a postdoctoral or assistant professor position for 2026; I anticipate graduating with my PhD in Spring 2025.**
