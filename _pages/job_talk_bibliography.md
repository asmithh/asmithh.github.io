| Litt, Eden, and Eszter Hargittai. 2016. “The Imagined Audience on Social Network Sites.” Social Media + Society 2 (1): 2056305116633482. https://doi.org/10.1177/2056305116633482. | 2 | In this mixed-methods study that combines a diary study, social network posts, and semi-structured interviews (we love a good mixed-methods study), Litt and Hargittai explain how people imagine their audiences when they create or share content on social media. People tended to imagine their audiences abstractly or with specific ties imagined within their audience, but imagined audiences might change from post to post. The way we think about our audiences has interesting implications for privacy practices as well as for understanding content creators' behavior.|
| Jackson, Sarah J., Moya Bailey, and Brooke Foucault Welles. 2020. #HashtagActivism: Networks of Race and Gender Justice. MIT Press. | 2 | You might have heard commentary decrying "hashtag activism," "keyboard warriors," and the like. Jackson et al. make a strong case for the power of digital activism in the form of networked counterpublics. Networked counterpublics are spaces where members of marginalized communities can produce knowledge and engage in discourse that challenges mainstream ways of knowing; the communities that form around hashtags like #MeToo or #GirlsLikeUs are examples of networked counterpublics. The book covers several cases where marginalized groups used hashtags to counter dominant narratives and bring about large-scale awareness and action.|
| Cinelli, Matteo, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales, Alessandro Galeazzi, Walter Quattrociocchi, and Michele Starnini. "The Echo Chamber Effect on Social Media." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 118, No. 9 (2021): e2023301118. | 2 | This study is particularly exciting because it is both large-scale and cross-platform -- it's hard to be both of these things! Cinelli et al. measure the extent to which interaction networks on Gab, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter are homophilous and information tends to spread between people with similar worldviews. They find that homophily, as determined via behavioral trace data, is indeed present when measured in these ways, although the degree to which it is present varies between platforms. |
| Kossinets, Gueorgi, and Duncan J. Watts. "Origins of homophily in an evolving social network." American Journal of Sociology 115, No. 2 (2009): 405-450.| 6 | Kossinets and Watts look at an evolving social network in a large university; they use email correspondence data to determine whether two individuals are linked. They're interested in looking at the effects of induced homophily (I am like the people I'm connected to because the people I had the opportunity to connect with are similar to me) versus choice homophily (I am like the people I'm connected to because I choose to connect with people like me). Ultimately, they find that it's complicated! Induced homophily and choice homophily interact with each other over time, amplifying each other's effects and resulting in noticeable patterns of homophily.|
| Newman, Mark EJ, and Michelle Girvan. "Finding and evaluating community structure in networks." Physical Review E 69, No. 2 (2004): 026113. | 7 | This paper introduces the Girvan-Newman algorithm for community detection, but it also provides a useful overview of what communities *are* and how network scientists have tried to define communities analytically in the past. There are some [limitations](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0605965104) to Girvan and Newman's approach to community detection, but this paper is a great gateway for thinking about community structure in networks.|
| Granovetter, Mark S. "The strength of weak ties." American Journal of Sociology 78, No. 6 (1973): 1360-1380.| 8 | Granovetter contrasts between strong ties (ties within your immediate community that you probably call on often) and weak ties (ties that extend outside your community and are more peripheral in your life). He argues that weak ties provide access to novel information that might not be accessible within someone's immediate community; having weak ties is advantageous. [This large-scale study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4476) on LinkedIn confirmed Granovetter's hypothesis.|
| Burt, Ronald S. "Structural holes and good ideas." American Journal of Sociology 110, No. 2 (2004): 349-399.| 8 | Burt's thesis is that people who bridge multiple communities -- in his words, people who bridge *structural holes* between communities in networks -- have more insights into other people's ways of thinking. People who broker connections across structural holes drive innovation and gain status within their organizations. |
| Obstfeld, David. "Social networks, the tertius iungens orientation, and involvement in innovation." Administrative Science Quarterly 50, No. 1 (2005): 100-130.| 9 | Obstfeld introduces the concept of the *tertius iungens,* which is Latin for "third who joins." The *tertius iungens* might introduce two people they know separately, but do not yet know each other. They also might reintroduce people who already know each other by recontextualizing the relationship. Obstfeld argues that having employees who behave as *tertius iungens* brokers tends to drive innovation within firms. |
| Smith, Alyssa Hasegawa, Jon Green, Brooke Foucault Welles, and David Lazer. 2025. “Emergent Structures of Attention on Social Media Are Driven by Amplification and Triad Transitivity.” PNAS Nexus, April 1, pgaf106. https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf106. | 10 | This is my favorite paper that I have written so far! We introduce the concept of the *attention broker* or *tertius amplificans* ("third who amplifies"). We provide empirical proof that there's a causal relationship between amplification by an attention broker and their followers following the amplified account. In other words, although many Twitter/X bios say "RT != endorsement," retweets are, in fact, taken as endorsement often enough that they affect how attention is structured online.|
| Schwarz, Carl James, and A. Neil Arnason. "Jolly-Seber models in MARK." MARK: a gentle introduction (eds. E. Cooch & G. White) Program, 8th edn. Available: http://www. phidot. org/software/mark/docs/book (2009). | 15 | This chapter provides a useful & practical overview of the Jolly-Seber algorithm and its usage for population estimation via mark-recapture events. Project MARK is an R software package that makes it possible to estimate population parameters like death rate, birth rate, and population ("abundance") using these mark-recapture methods & capture histories of individual animals. | 
| Holland, Paul W., and Samuel Leinhardt. "Transitivity in structural models of small groups." Comparative Group Studies 2, No. 2 (1971): 107-124.| 21 | This one is a bit math-heavy! It delves into the idea of the transitive graph as the core concept underlying the structural features of social networks. Holland and Leinhardt observe that there are more transitive triads in social network data than we might expect and suggest that triads that aren't transitive are in fact unstable. This instability can be resolved, and the overall network configuration be made more stable, by making the intransitive triad a transitive one (perhaps by way of a *tertius iungens*?) |
| Bianconi, Ginestra, Richard K. Darst, Jacopo Iacovacci, and Santo Fortunato. 2014. “Triadic Closure as a Basic Generating Mechanism of Communities in Complex Networks.” Physical Review E 90 (4): 042806. https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.042806. | 21 | Bianconi et al. find that if you model network growth with triad closure as your core assumption & main driving force behind tie formation, you recover many characteristics of real networks with this simple assumption. We see community structure, high clustering coefficients, and the heavy-tailed node degree distribution that is the hallmark of real networks (including social networks).|
| Qiu, Jingyi, Yan Chen, Alain Cohn, and Alvin E. Roth. 2024. “Social Media and Job Market Success: A Field Experiment on Twitter.” SSRN Scholarly Paper No. 4778120. Rochester, NY, May 20. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4778120. | 22 | In this paper, PhD candidates on the tenure-track job market for economics (who were also on Twitter and had posted about their job market papers) were randomized into a treatment group, whose job market papers were retweeted by prominent economists, and a control group, who did not receive a retweet as part of this experiment. They found that the PhD candidates in the treatment group were substantially affected by the retweets -- the effect on the number of initial interviews, flyouts, and offers they received outstripped experts' expectations.|
| Green, Jon, Stefan McCabe, Sarah Shugars, Hanyu Chwe, Luke Horgan, Shuyang Cao, and David Lazer. "Curation Bubbles." American Political Science Review (2025): 1-19. | 23 | It's pretty well-established that some news outlets tend to be shared more by conservatives and others tend to be shared more by liberals. However, we do see some cross-partisan sharing occurring at the outlet level. What happens if we analyze sharing behavior at the article level, looking at many article URLs for each outlet? It turns out that you can reinforce your partisan worldviews with content from a mix of different sources; an article from the New York Times might read favorably to conservatives, for example, and so they share that specific article with each other at higher rates than liberals do. Instead of partisan echo chambers, where users only get news from favored sources, we can think about partisan curation bubbles, where users curate news from a wide variety of sources that still confirms their worldview.|
| Smith, Alyssa, Ilya Amburg, Sagar Kumar, Brooke Foucault Welles, and Nicholas W. Landry. 2025. “A Blue Start: A Large-Scale Pairwise and Higher-Order Social Network Dataset.” arXiv:2505.11608. Preprint, arXiv, May 16. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.11608. | 26 | In this paper, my collaborators and I collected the entire Bluesky following network (as of February 2025) as well as all the starter packs made on Bluesky through February 2025. Any user can make a starter pack; starter packs are collections of users, often relevant to a particular theme or topic. Anyone can follow all the users in a starter pack simultaneously by clicking one button. We provide some exploratory analyses of the starter pack dataset and the following network. The starter pack dataset exhibits some pretty interesting patterns that reflect both the Bluesky user interface as well as events that occurred off the platform over 2024-2025. The datset we collected is available for download [here](https://doi.org/10.3886/kf6e-zq94).|
| DeVito, Michael A., Darren Gergle, and Jeremy Birnholtz. 2017. “‘Algorithms Ruin Everything’: #RIPTwitter, Folk Theories, and Resistance to Algorithmic Change in Social Media.” Proceedings of the 2017 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (New York, NY, USA), CHI ’17, May 2, 3163–74. https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025659. | 28 | This paper launched a really rich vein of research into algorithmic folk theories on social media platforms. If you've ever thought about why "the algorithm" is showing you videos of angry elephant seals or why nobody ever watches the cute videos you post of your dog (hi it's me), maybe even acted on the causal path you came up with in your head, congratulations! You have engaged in algorithmic folk theorization. DeVito et al. analyze over 100k tweets about the rumored introduction of algorithmic curation to Twitter to understand how people made meaning about algorithmic curation. Their findings are incredibly rich, and this work has paved the way for some very exciting research (hopefully my own included, soon!) |
