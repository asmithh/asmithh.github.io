| Kossinets, Gueorgi, and Duncan J. Watts. "Origins of homophily in an evolving social network." American Journal of Sociology 115, No. 2 (2009): 405-450.| TBD | Kossinets and Watts look at an evolving social network in a large university; they use email correspondence data to determine whether two individuals are linked. They're interested in looking at the effects of induced homophily (I am like the people I'm connected to because the people I had the opportunity to connect with are similar to me) versus choice homophily (I am like the people I'm connected to because I choose to connect with people like me). Ultimately, they find that it's complicated! Induced homophily and choice homophily interact with each other over time, amplifying each other's effects and resulting in noticeable patterns of homophily.|
| Newman, Mark EJ, and Michelle Girvan. "Finding and evaluating community structure in networks." Physical review E 69, no. 2 (2004): 026113. | TBD | This paper introduces the Girvan-Newman algorithm for community detection, but it also provides a useful overview of what communities *are* and how network scientists have tried to define communities analytically in the past. There are some [limitations](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.0605965104) to Girvan and Newman's approach to community detection, but this paper is a great gateway for thinking about community structure in networks.|
| Granovetter, Mark S. "The strength of weak ties." American Journal of Sociology 78, No. 6 (1973): 1360-1380.| TBD | Granovetter contrasts between strong ties (ties within your immediate community that you probably call on often) and weak ties (ties that extend outside your community and are more peripheral in your life). He argues that weak ties provide access to novel information that might not be accessible within someone's immediate community; having weak ties is advantageous. [This large-scale study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4476) on LinkedIn confirmed Granovetter's hypothesis.|
