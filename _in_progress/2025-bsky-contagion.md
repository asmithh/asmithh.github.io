title: "Optimally Seeding Influence in Dyadic Networks using Higher-Order Interactions"
collection: in_progress
permalink: /in_progress/bsky-contagion
excerpt: "Using our A Blue Start dataset, which combines a higher-order Bluesky starter pack network with a dyadic following network, we want to figure out whether running influence maximization on a hypergraph (i.e. the starter pack network) can empirically also produce a highly influential set of seed nodes for spreading processes on the dyadic following network."
